            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I used to work as a Travel Advisor, specialist of Northeast of China. However, in December 2020, I lost my job because of Covid. Rather than wait for the tourism to get back to normal, I decided to change career. </p>
            <p>I was already very interested by WordPress but I wanted to be able to put some code into WordPress, so I started to learn about Web Development in February 2021 with HTML and CSS first, then with JavaScript and PHP. I learned a bit about Git, GitHib, Bootstrap, etc. From July 2021 to December 2021, I went into Web Development in depth with a code school by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, Bullma, WorpdPress, MVC, OOP, PDO, SASS, VueJs, and a lot lot more. It was very intense and I wasn't able to understand and remember evrything, so after some months to practice and learn by myself, I took a pro membership with codecademy and enrolled for the Full-Stack Engineer career path! This Portfolio website is part of of the projects codecademy make me to do. Next below some projects I did since February 2020.</p>
            <p>I enrolled the Full-Stack Engineer path because I want to be able to review what I learn in code school, but since I started to learn to code, I can see my preference is Front-end. I love to work with WordPress and PHP, but I really enjoy to play with CSS. And even if I have some difficulties, it is a great pleasure to work with JavaScript.</p>

          <p>First commit: <span class="textBold">6 June 2022</span></p>
          <p>This is a <a href="">codecademy</a> project. I had to fix a broken version of a responsive website. If you check my GitHub for this project, the broken website version is in the main branch and the fixed version is in the develop branch. Only HTML and CSS, but I mostly worked with the CSS.</p>
