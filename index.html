          <p>
            I used to work as a Travel Advisor, specialist of Northeast of China from 2017 to 2020. However, in December 2020, I lost my
            job because of Covid. Rather than wait for the tourism to get back to normal, I decided to change career.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was already very interested by WordPress but I wanted to be able to put some code into WordPress, so I
            started to learn about Web Development in February 2021 with HTML and CSS first, then with JavaScript and
            PHP. I learned a bit about Git, GitHib, Bootstrap, etc. From July 2021 to December 2021, I went into Web
            Development in depth with a code school by learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap,
            Bullma, WorpdPress, MVC, OOP, PDO, SASS, VueJs, and a lot lot more. It was very intense and I wasn't able to
            understand and remember evrything, so after some months to practice and learn by myself, I took a pro
            membership with codecademy and enrolled for the Full-Stack Engineer career path! This Portfolio website is
            part of of the projects codecademy make me to do. Next below some projects I did since February 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled the Full-Stack Engineer path because I want to be able to review what I learn in code school at
            my paces, but since I started to learn to code, I can see my preference is Front-end. I love to work with
            WordPress and PHP, but I really enjoy to play with CSS. And even if I have some difficulties, it is a great
            pleasure to work with JavaScript. So I might decide to enroll the Frontend path if I have enough with the
            back when I will be there.

            used a plugin that we have coded when I was in code school, with one of my teacher. I used the plugin basics
            but I have to adapt it to the website and code a lot more to be able to use it. I mainly use PHP. I tried to
            put the site on Internet but I am really not an admin system so it didn't really work, so I put a link but
            the dropdown doesn't work and the database is not finished at all.

            This project was started by a team of 3 people included myself. we used WordPress backoffice to work,
            incorporated a bootstrap theme, did a plugin to manage the subscribers, etc. We mostly used PHP with some
            JavaScript and Vue.js. We had to code the project in 2 weeks before to introduce it on Youtube. It was very
            exhausting to do but very interesting as well. It is a WordPress website and it is not on Internet so no
            website link. This project it is not only mine so I do not explain how to install it locally, but if you
            check my others projects, it won't be hard to know how...
